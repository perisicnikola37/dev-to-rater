Hereâ€™s a link to the file demonstrating proper paragraph length handling:
[Code in repository.](https://github.com/perisicnikola37/dev-to-rater/blob/v2.x/analyzer/src/core/calculateParagraphLengthScore.ts)

### Code we use - Preview

```typescript typescript
export const calculateParagraphScore = (paragraphs: string[]): number => {
  let scoreChange = 0;

  paragraphs.forEach((paragraph) => {
    const wordCount = paragraph.split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length;

    // If the paragraph has less than 5 words, add points
    if (wordCount < 5) {
      scoreChange += 0.5;
    }
    // If the paragraph has more than 15 words, subtract points
    else if (wordCount > 15) {
      const excessWords = wordCount - 15;
      scoreChange -= excessWords * 0.05;
    }
  });

  return scoreChange;
};
```

<Tip>Aim for paragraphs between 5-15 words to strike the right balance.</Tip>
