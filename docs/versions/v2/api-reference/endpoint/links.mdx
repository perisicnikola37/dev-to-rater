### Code we use - Preview

```typescript typescript
const rules = [
  {
    condition: links.length === 0,
    apply: () => {
      penalty += 0.2;
    },
  },
  {
    condition: links.length > 20,
    apply: () => {
      penalty += 0.15;
    },
  },
];
```

<Tip>
  Aim to have a moderate number of links in your article. Having too many or too
  few links can negatively affect your score.
