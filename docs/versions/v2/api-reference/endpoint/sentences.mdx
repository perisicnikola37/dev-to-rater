### Code we use - Preview

```typescript typescript
const rules = [
  {
    condition: sentences.length === 0,
    apply: () => {
      penalty += 1;
    },
  },
  {
    condition: true,
    apply: () => {
      sentences.forEach((sentence) => {
        const wordCount = sentence.split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length;

        if (wordCount > WORDS_LIMIT_PER_SENTENCE) {
          const excessWords = wordCount - WORDS_LIMIT_PER_SENTENCE;
          penalty += Math.round(excessWords * 0.025 * 100) / 100;

          exceededSentences.push(sentence);
        }
      });
    },
  },
];
```

<Tip>
  To strike the right balance, aim for sentences containing between 10 and 25
  words.
