### Paragraph Length

Long sentences can decrease readability and make content harder to understand. Keep sentences concise for better engagement.

- **Guideline**: If a sentence exceeds **15 words**, it receives a lower readability score.
- **Why**: Short sentences are easier to read, process, and retain.

### Example

**Before** (too long):  
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping peacefully under the shade of a tree, unaware of the events unfolding around him."

**After** (concise):  
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping under a tree."

<Tip>
  Breaking long sentences into smaller, digestible chunks improves clarity and
  retention.{" "}
