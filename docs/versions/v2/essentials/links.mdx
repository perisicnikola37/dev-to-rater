### Perfect Links Frequency

Having the right number of links in your content is essential for guiding readers to additional resources and improving engagement. However, both an excess of links and a lack of them can negatively affect readability and the overall user experience. Here's how to find the perfect balance:

- **Too few links:** If there are no links, readers may not have access to further valuable content or external sources, which can limit the depth of the article.
- **Too many links:** Too many links can overwhelm readers, making the content feel cluttered and distracting.

### Examples of calculating penalty points

- No links: - **0.2** points
- 20 links or fewer: - **0** penalty
- More than 20 links: - **0.15** points

<Tip>
  Make sure your article includes relevant links, but avoid overloading it with
  too many.
