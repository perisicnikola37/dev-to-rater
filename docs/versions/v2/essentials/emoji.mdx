### Perfect Emojis

Emojis can enhance the engagement of your content, making it feel more relatable and fun. However, overusing emojis can negatively impact readability.

- **Guideline**: If a sentence contains more than **2 emojis**, the readability score decreases.
- **Why**: Too many emojis can distract readers and make the content harder to follow.
- **When to use Emojis:**
  Use emojis to add personality, express emotions, or draw attention to key points. They work best when they complement the message, **not overpower it**.

### Example

**Before** (too many emojis):  
"I love writing docs! ✍️✨🎉 It's the best part of my job. 🔥🔥"

**After** (balanced):  
"I love writing docs! ✍️ It's the best part of my job."

<Tip>
  Use emojis cautiously to complement your message without overwhelming readers.
