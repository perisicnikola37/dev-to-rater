### Perfect Headings

Counting the total number of characters in a text is useful for measuring its length and ensuring readability. Characters include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces. Understanding the character count helps you adjust the content to maintain an optimal reading length.

- **Guideline**: If a text exceeds **15,000** characters, it receives a lower readability score.
- **Why**: Excessive character count can make the text feel too long and tiresome to read. Monitoring the character count can indicate whether the content needs to be shortened or split into smaller sections.

### Example

**Before** (Total Characters: 129):
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping peacefully under the shade of a tree, unaware of the events unfolding around him."

**After** (Total Characters: 89):
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping under a tree."

<Tip>
  By monitoring the total character count, you can ensure your text remains
  within a readable length.
