Alt text is essential for accessibility and SEO, providing context to users who cannot see the images, such as those using screen readers.

- **Guideline**: All images should have **descriptive alt text**.
- **Why**: Missing alt text decreases accessibility and lowers the readability score.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="../../../images/logo.png" />

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add alt to images using the following code

```md
![alt text](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
```
