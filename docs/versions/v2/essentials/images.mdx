### Perfect Images

Ensure all images have descriptive alt text for accessibility and better readability.

**Alt text** is essential for accessibility and SEO, providing context to users who cannot see the images, such as those using screen readers. All images should have **descriptive alt text**.

- **Guideline**: If image does not contains `alt` property defined, the readability score decreases.
- **Why**: Missing `alt` text decreases accessibility. It also negatively impacts SEO, as search engines rely on `alt` text to understand and index images, potentially lowering your blog post page's ranking.

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add alt to images using the following code

```md
![alt text](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
```
