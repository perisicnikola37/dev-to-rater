### Perfect Paragraphs

Long paragraphs can decrease readability and make content harder to understand. Keep paragraphs concise for better engagement.

- **Guideline**: If a paragraph exceeds **15 words**, it receives a lower readability score.
- **Why**: Short paragraphs are easier to read, process, and retain.

### Example

**Before** (too long):  
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping peacefully under the shade of a tree, unaware of the events unfolding around him."

**After** (concise):  
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, who was sleeping under a tree."

<Tip>Breaking long paragraphs into smaller chunks improves clarity.</Tip>
