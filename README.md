## Documentation

For detailed documentation, please visit the [Dev.to Rater Documentation](https://docs.dev-to-rater.xyz).

## About

**Dev.to Rater** is a tool that analyzes your post content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, to help enhance the readability and engagement of your content. 
This tool helps you to write posts more <ins>impactful</ins> and <ins>engaging</ins>.

## Available calculations

1. **Sentence Length**  
   If a sentence contains more than 15 words, it receives a lower readability score. Long sentences can make the content harder to read and understand, so reducing sentence length improves overall readability and engagement.

2. **Paragraph Length**  
   Similarly, the tool evaluates the length of each paragraph. If a paragraph exceeds a certain number of words (150 words), the score decreases.

3. **Emoji Usage**  
   Emojis can enhance the engagement of your content, but overuse can negatively impact readability. **Dev.to Rater** calculates the number of emojis in each sentence. If a sentence contains more than 2 emojis, the score decreases.

4. **Headings Structure**  
   The tool analyzes the structure and distribution of headings (e.g., `h1`, `h2`, `h3`). If headings are improperly used (e.g., no `h2` after `h1`, missing subheadings), the score will decrease.

5. **Image Alt Text**  
   The tool checks if all images have descriptive alt text. If an image has missing alt text, it will decrease the score.

Detailed calculations logic can be found [here](https://docs.dev-to-rater.xyz/versions/v2/api-reference/introduction).
